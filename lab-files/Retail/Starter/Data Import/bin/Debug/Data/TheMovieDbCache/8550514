As they enter the system using a VR simulation, their mission quickly turns into a delirious trap far more complex than expected, as the fabric of reality starts unraveling around them.

Dick-esque mind-melting weirdness to achieve truly unclassifiable results.","poster_path":"/w32OklsGLGZouUd6HPP7IIcg0wP.jpg","release_date":"2019-07-10","title":"Jesus Shows You the Way to the Highway","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1,"popularity":2.531}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

When Max's lighthearted prank on his high-school principal finally gets his longtime crush, Roxanne, to notice him, he asks her on a date. Max's trouble at school convinces Goofy that he and the boy need to bond over a cross-country fishing trip like the one he took with his dad when he was Max's age, which throws a kink in his son's plans to impress Roxanne.","poster_path":"/bycmMhO3iIoEDzP768sUjq2RV4T.jpg","popularity":11.216}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

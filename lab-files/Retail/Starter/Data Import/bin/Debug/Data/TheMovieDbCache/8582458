In addition to photography, she also conducts videography. Interestingly enough, mysteries have a way of finding her and she has a strong intuition and knack of solving them. Sometimes the mystery comes through the doors of the shop, sometimes it might be something she sees while shooting on-assignment, and sometimes she'll spot something at a crime scene that everybody missed. Alexa's character also uses her videography skills to start a part-time job - she gets a police scanner and begins to take the store van to breaking stories - could be a fire, could be an accident or even a murder. If her footage is good, she tries to sell it to local news stations for broadcast.","poster_path":null,"release_date":"2019-06-16","title":"Picture Perfect Mysteries: Newlywed and Dead","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":4,"popularity":2.427}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

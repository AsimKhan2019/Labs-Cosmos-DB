It’s also a journey through reflections on male condition, an attempt to strip away beliefs, myths and prejudices about masculinity. Why is there violence against women? We try to answer that by the hand of a former pimp trapped by his past and an artist, son of a prostitute, who transforms his pain into provocative performances. In parallel, the class of a high school teacher and a team of publicists become debate scenarios on the same theme, while interspersed reflections of several influential men who address the issue of masculinity from multiple points of view. A rich and complex approach that invites us to reflect on our own gender related education and socialization.","poster_path":"/nG1hBS97HQaKXGD3slkE8BknuCr.jpg","release_date":"2018-10-21","title":"You Will Be a Man","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"popularity":0.6}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

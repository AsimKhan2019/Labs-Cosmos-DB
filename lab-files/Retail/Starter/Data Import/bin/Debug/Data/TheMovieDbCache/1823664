Originally left by her parents as a baby with the promise that they'd be back for her someday, it's been a hard knock life ever since with her mean foster mom Miss Hannigan. But everything's about to change when the hard-nosed tycoon and New York mayoral candidate Will Stacks—advised by his brilliant VP and his shrewd and scheming campaign advisor—makes a thinly-veiled campaign move and takes her in. Stacks believes he's her guardian angel, but Annie's self-assured nature and bright, sun-will-come-out-tomorrow outlook on life just might mean it's the other way around.","poster_path":"/hkvKhuUUgjJ4jrXKkvqoQ5JnQx5.jpg","release_date":"2014-12-19","title":"Annie","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":816,"popularity":14.872}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

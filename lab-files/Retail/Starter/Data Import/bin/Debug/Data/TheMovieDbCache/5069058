Most of them go back once the season gets over. Few choose to stay back, digging deeper into the traces of a hippie hangover, or trying to search oneself through the incandescent, colorful, trippy shores of Goa. And a few yet, get in so deep at the wrong end of paradise, that they are lost forever, in the same place, but in a whole different world altogether. The film takes one such real-life character - Roy - through a plethora of happenings, phenomena, legends, myths, sights, sounds, experiences and thrilling stories of the fabled Goan paradise. What happens to the protagonist through the bitter-sweet, darkly funny, crazy, trippy journey and what comes along at the end of it, weaves the half-fictitious/half-real story of our film - CandyFlip.","poster_path":"/42t6PNrNXdiOUrxuSvATMOEQ852.jpg","release_date":"2019-02-15","title":"Candyflip","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1,"popularity":0.977}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

Max Cady is a tattooed, cigar-smoking, bible-quoting, psychotic rapist. What do they have in common? Fourteen years ago, Sam was a public defender assigned to Max Cady's rape trial, and he made a serious error: he hid a document from his illiterate client that could have gotten him acquitted. Now, the cagey, bibliophile Cady has been released, and he intends to teach Sam Bowden and his family a thing or two about loss.","poster_path":"/4KvrvcqckdupXXO2YnANtyG7QLK.jpg","release_date":"1991-11-15","title":"Cape Fear","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":1484,"popularity":16.397}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

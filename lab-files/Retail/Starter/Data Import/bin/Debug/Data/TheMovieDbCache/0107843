However, top-secret US government agent 'Bob' arranges a staged death, so Maggie can be elaborately trained as a phantom killer and subdued into obedience. She gets a new cover identity as saleswoman Claudia Anne Doran. She also gets a wonderful house-mate, building super J.P., a broad-minded, gentle photographer. The two fall in love, and that complicates hit jobs. His good influence extends to breeding in her a conscience that places love over business, unlike Bob's agency.","poster_path":"/kOfSTm2cftavsyB49amnhW3is9y.jpg","release_date":"1993-03-19","title":"Point of No Return","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":213,"popularity":8.51}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

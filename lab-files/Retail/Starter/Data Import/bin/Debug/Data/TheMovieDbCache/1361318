As the couple faces the loss of their dream to have a house and start a family, they discover that the tenant in the apartment below them is dead, and he's left behind a stash of cash—$400,000 worth. Though initially hesitant, Tom and Anna decide that the plan is simple: all they have to do is quietly take the money and use only what's necessary to get them out of debt. But when they start spending the money and can't seem to stop, they find themselves the target of a deadly adversary—the thief who stole it—and that's when very bad things start happening to good people.","poster_path":"/5dpxUZluqkIVSxCb5h0xRvcpkFE.jpg","release_date":"2014-09-26","title":"Good People","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":283,"popularity":8.105}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

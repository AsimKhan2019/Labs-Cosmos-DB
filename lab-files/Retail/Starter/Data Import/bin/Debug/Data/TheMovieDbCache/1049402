Howl, the film, recounts this dark moment using three interwoven threads: the tumultuous life events that led a young Allen Ginsberg to find his true voice as an artist, society's reaction (the obscenity trial), and mind-expanding animation that echoes the startling originality of the poem itself. All three coalesce in a genre-bending hybrid that brilliantly captures a pivotal moment-the birth of a counterculture.","poster_path":"/oc5MVYd2hzvt76Oa4IoFnaxLkht.jpg","popularity":6.021}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

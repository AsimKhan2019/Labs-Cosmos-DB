Every one of the 65,000 frames of the film is an oil-painting hand-painted by 125 professional oil-painters who travelled from all across the world to the Loving Vincent studios in Poland and Greece to be a part of the production. As remarkable as Vincentâ€™s brilliant paintings are his passionate and ill-fated life and mysterious death.","poster_path":"/56sq57kDm7XgyXBYrgJLumo0Jac.jpg","release_date":"2017-06-22","title":"Loving Vincent","video":false,"vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":1284,"popularity":10.427}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

Try as he may, he cannot live up to the macho image expected of him by his family, by his heritage. At the age of 19 he is conscripted into the South African army and finds his every sensibility offended by a system close to its demise, and yet still in full force. Set during the South African border war against communism, this is a long overdue story about the emotional and physical suffering endured by countless young men.","poster_path":"/ksTglwt1m7WGkV1XXnjQybfGsbV.jpg","release_date":"2019-09-04","title":"Moffie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"popularity":12.881}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

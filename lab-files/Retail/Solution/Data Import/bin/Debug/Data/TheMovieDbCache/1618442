Armies of witch hunters have battled this unnatural enemy for centuries, including Kaulder, a valiant warrior who many years ago slayed the all-powerful Witch Queen, decimating her followers in the process. In the moments right before her death, the Queen cursed Kaulder with immortality, forever separating him from his beloved wife and daughter. Today, Kaulder is the last living hunter who has spent his immortal life tracking down rogue witches, all the while yearning for his long-lost family.","poster_path":"/ke0ktdLpTyDKsMuJTyMXFVK4xej.jpg","release_date":"2015-10-21","title":"The Last Witch Hunter","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":2275,"popularity":15.739}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

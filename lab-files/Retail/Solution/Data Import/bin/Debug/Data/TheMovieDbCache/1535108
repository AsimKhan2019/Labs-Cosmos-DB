Secretary Rhodes (Jodie Foster), a hard line government ofﬁcial, will stop at nothing to enforce anti-immigration laws and preserve the luxurious lifestyle of the citizens of Elysium. That doesn’t stop the people of Earth from trying to get in, by any means they can. When unlucky Max (Matt Damon) is backed into a corner, he agrees to take on a daunting mission that, if successful, will not only save his life, but could bring equality to these polarized worlds.","poster_path":"/tHkjoAxmhp3Eau1h0Ir7maKMwUz.jpg","release_date":"2013-08-07","title":"Elysium","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":5586,"popularity":17.909}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

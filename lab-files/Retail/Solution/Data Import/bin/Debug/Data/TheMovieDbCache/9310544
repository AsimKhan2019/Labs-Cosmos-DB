She is a good student, very strict with herself and she is always on time. She also takes care of her two younger brothers; since her mother Vera died, she’s felt responsible for the family and now she takes care of the household with her father. One morning — rushing to school to help her math teacher print exams — she is struck by a large truck and she dies. In the hereafter she finds her mother waiting for her. It's a strange feeling of both happiness and sadness. She discovers that there is a way back to life, but will she succeed in taking her mother with her?","poster_path":"/lr4If4IUdETHf2xALOLHxaJu86W.jpg","release_date":"2019-02-19","title":"Afterlife","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"popularity":0.716}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

The final moments of the final game have become one of the most controversial events in Olympic history. With play tied, the score table horn sounded during a second free throw attempt that put the U.S. ahead by one. But the Soviets claimed they had called for a time out before the basket and confusion ensued. The clock was set back by three seconds twice in a row and the Russians finally prevailed at the very last. The U.S. protested, but a jury decided in the USSR’s favor and Team USA voted unanimously to refuse its silver medals. The Soviet players have been treated as heroes at home.","poster_path":"/g7dr7pC2JYOBi3heCudlI5Ec5jY.jpg","release_date":"2017-12-28","title":"Three Seconds","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":64,"popularity":7.804}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

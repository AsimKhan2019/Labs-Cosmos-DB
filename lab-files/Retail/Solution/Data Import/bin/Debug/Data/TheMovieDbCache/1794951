Inspired by transwoman Mahogany who, as the mother of the scene, presided over queer strip shows and balls for non-heterosexual audiences in the 1980s, butch Ronnie Ron created, produced and presented the new shows. In them, the largely female clientele from the ‘hood’ slipped dollar notes into lap dancers’ panties while celebrating lesbian sexuality to pulsating hip-hop beats.","poster_path":"/pWFN1MBxDzyrHRLk000KrSSobXK.jpg","release_date":"2018-02-17","title":"Shakedown","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1,"popularity":1.4}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

In the film, this link between his writing and his private life is depicted by live-action and animated scenes that draw exclusively on the writer’s works and letters to his loved ones. For an entire decade, he lived with the Löffler family in Vienna, where he wrote most of his impressive oeuvre. First, he grew very close to the lady of the house, then to her adolescent daughter Steffi. Back in Ljubljana, he got involved with several girls there, an attentive lover of a cheerful nature, accessible and highly intelligent. His popular public lectures reveal him as a passionate social democrat.","poster_path":"/zLP650FLaFXUdCue2cT0wZLoHmk.jpg","release_date":"2018-11-12","title":"Cankar","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"popularity":1.449}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

While his brother becomes drawn into left-wing politics, Accio, the hotheaded younger brother, is taken under the wing of a market trader and while under his influence, joins the Fascist party. Accio (\"Bully\") is a nickname he is proud of because it makes him seem tough. Manrico and their sister Violetta are alarmed to hear their brother listening to Benito Mussolini's speeches in his room. Manrico often physically torments his brother, including stuffing his head in the barrel under the drain pipe of their house.","poster_path":"/vhGgLFl5DFzbU842JAwmWjWUnSf.jpg","release_date":"2007-04-20","title":"My Brother Is an Only Child","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":169,"popularity":6.145}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

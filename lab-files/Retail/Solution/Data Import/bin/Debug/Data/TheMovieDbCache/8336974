Masaryk meet in the gardens of Topolcianky castle to decide about the fate of their joint literary work. Their fiction film dialogue is based on quotes from a future book and their mutual correspondence, considerably freeing the original format of literary conversation from binding conventions. Capek and Masaryk reproach and offend each other, but they also ask key personal questions and questions about the social functions of a writer and politician respectively. \"It's a film about two extraordinary men; it's about the fact that emotions can be sometimes more powerful than ideas even in such exceptional people.","poster_path":"/2PXSQKcAofWSL0Ki8KptGFYrHGj.jpg","release_date":"2018-10-18","title":"Talks with TGM","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"popularity":1.4}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

{"movie_results":[{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":null,"genre_ids":[18],"id":475855,"original_language":"it","original_title":"Manuel","overview":"An eighteen-year-old boy is released from an institute for minors with no family support, and for the first time tastes the bittersweet flavor of freedom; an imprisoned mother longs to go back and start all over again. These are the characters taken from the real world and transferred into a film that is first of all a shadowing of human beings, of their hopes and little acts of cowardice. But it is also the story of a time of waiting, of a soul going around in circles, a coming of age in a desolate and oppressive, marginal context that becomes a character in its own right.","poster_path":"/4cS3mNVLzecBvvyKqe0MtmvdoQT.jpg","release_date":"2018-03-07","title":"Manuel","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":12,"popularity":1.355}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

Jo is the bright spark in Claireâ€™s recently darkened reality; a new friend in an otherwise isolated world. The two young women hit the town to let off some steam-and find themselves in trouble with local law enforcement. In the blink of an eye, Claire discovers that Jo is not what she seems-not at all-and her easy friendship with the lighthearted, young woman splits open to reveal the truth. Luminously shot in black and white, Josephine Doe is a raw exploration of family trauma and mental health that shows the thin line between our realities.","poster_path":"/dddw96PHoVaheCBMz6jyPgv1K93.jpg","release_date":"2018-03-06","title":"Josephine Doe","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":3,"popularity":1.841}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

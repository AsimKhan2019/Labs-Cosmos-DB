It looks at the proliferation of one typeface (which will celebrate its 50th birthday in 2007) as part of a larger conversation about the way type affects our lives. The film is an exploration of urban spaces in major cities and the type that inhabits them, and a fluid discussion with renowned designers about their work, the creative process, and the choices and aesthetics behind their use of type.","poster_path":"/sQdMGO8slfUxOu2LOGUirWWJPMM.jpg","popularity":6.119}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

Given voice, the thoughts take us to the bilingual villages of south Carinthia. The year is 1976, when the Austrian national government requests that members of minorities be counted across the country, to establish whether a minority is eligible for bilingual place-name signs. The census is broadly boycotted by the Slovenian minority in Carinthia. In a small mountain village of Sele, four boys decide to carry out a unique operation: to hijack the ballot box.","poster_path":"/x953P4HzKQIpXdpG02w0hKLxBZc.jpg","release_date":"2018-11-18","title":"Sine Legibus 1976","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"popularity":1.4}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

The reaction was universal: her sponsors abandoned her, she was disowned by her parents, banned from competing, and she changed her name to \"Janae\". This film follows Janae as she attempts to find her place in society. Initially wanting to strip off the muscle and become a much smaller looking woman, she found herself unable to lose the muscle she so desperately gained. She now finds herself living one day as an alpha male and the next day as a delicate girl. Will Janae be able to handle her muscle relapses? Will her passage from being a male bring her the peace she's looking for? Will society accept a 250lbs muscular woman? Is her path personal redemption or physical and psychological disaster?","poster_path":"/spg4k1XxbsjpfmfTjTsp70Rs92c.jpg","release_date":"2018-04-27","title":"Transformer","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":12,"popularity":3.679}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

She and her grandmother accidentally find themselves at the circumcision of a little child, and there someone tells her about a tradition quite strange to the outsiders: if a woman who cannot get pregnant eats the foreskin of a baby, life will take a turn for the better.  Israeli director Shirley Sasson-Ezer shows intergenerational relationships that are full of love and are devoid of aggression and yet are still complicated by the insurmountable obstacles of differences in worldviews.","poster_path":null,"release_date":"2019-04-08","title":"Offspring","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"popularity":0.76}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

We begin in the present as an unseen narrator recounts the assassination of his lover's disapproving mother, accompanied by hauntingly vacant images of urban alienation and garish city lights; we then flash back to witness the first encounter between the lovers-turned-accomplices, their mutual attraction and world-weariness emerging across a sleepless night and morning after. Çevik imbues the proceedings with a stylistic confidence and willingness to bend the conventions of cinematic form to arrive at a complex, gripping double meditation on love and death.","poster_path":"/pheXEk1WNY7Azcy5bfPSDngFZ2M.jpg","release_date":"2019-02-07","title":"Belonging","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"popularity":0.674}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

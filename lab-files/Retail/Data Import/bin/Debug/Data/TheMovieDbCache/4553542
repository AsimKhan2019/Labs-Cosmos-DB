The Need to Grow takes an intimate look into the hearts of activists and innovators in the food movement who are redesigning our future; an eight-year-old girl who challenges the ethics of a beloved organisation, a renegade farmer struggling to keep his land as he revolutionises resource-efficient agriculture, and an accomplished visionary inventor facing catastrophe in the midst of developing a game changing technology.","poster_path":"/kiCdMEuxJtntudON9Faqdm0W312.jpg","release_date":"2019-03-07","title":"The Need to Grow","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"popularity":0.741}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

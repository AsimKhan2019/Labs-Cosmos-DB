Til Schweiger comes up with a slickly-made off-the-wall romantic comedy drama \"Barfuss\" (Barefoot), his first solo directing effort in nearly a decade.  Punchy, anti-establishment tone, with Schweiger playing a hedonistic bachelor - he is his rich family's black sheep - who falls for a suicidal mental patient (Johanna Wokalek).  An offbeat, strangely tender love story develops as Nick struggles with responsibility for the first time in his life.","poster_path":"/aN4dn64CVkdYbCLroxspDHEFX9g.jpg","release_date":"2005-03-30","title":"Barefoot","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":96,"popularity":7.923}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

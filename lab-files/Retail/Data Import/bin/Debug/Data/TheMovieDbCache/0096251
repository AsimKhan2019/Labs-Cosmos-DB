This, his third film, is an extremely graphic but also strikingly-filmed fantasy shot in the same low-budget, underground-production style as his first two films. Revolving around the transformation of people into grotesque hybrids of flesh and metal, Tetsuo is above all an overwhelming audiovisual experience, set to a brain-pounding score by Chu Ishikawa and complemented by suitably exaggerated sound effects.","poster_path":"/sIygsUfPDD7pfdvmZR9PKArZ2Jp.jpg","release_date":"1989-07-01","title":"Tetsuo: The Iron Man","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":205,"popularity":10.268}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

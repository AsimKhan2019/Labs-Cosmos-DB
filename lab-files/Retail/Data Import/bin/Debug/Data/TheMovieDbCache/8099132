Soaking up its bustling metropolises and tranquil countryside, Allah introduces us to a succession of vividly rendered souls who call this island home. Their candid testimonies create a polyphonic symphony, set against a visual prayer of indelible portraiture. Thoroughly immersed between the sacred and profane, BLACK MOTHER channels rebellion and reverence into a deeply personal ode informed by Jamaicaâ€™s turbulent history but existing in the urgent present.","poster_path":"/6lD2qZWM7CKxlcme6YDmdXJw4UV.jpg","popularity":1.409}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

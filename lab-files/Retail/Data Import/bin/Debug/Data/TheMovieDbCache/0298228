From then on, Whangara chiefs, always the first-born, always male, have been considered Paikea's direct descendants. Pai, an 11-year-old girl in a patriarchal New Zealand tribe, believes she is destined to be the new chief. But her grandfather Koro is bound by tradition to pick a male leader. Pai loves Koro more than anyone in the world, but she must fight him and a thousand years of tradition to fulfill her destiny.","poster_path":"/x6qMQ6LActtQSjuXidzuhqVW3AT.jpg","popularity":7.021}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

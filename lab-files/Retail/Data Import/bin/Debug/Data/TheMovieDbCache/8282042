In the Donbass, war is called peace, propaganda is uttered as truth and hatred is declared to be love. A journey through the Donbas unfolds as a chain of curious adventures, where the grotesque and drama are as intertwined as life and death.  This is not a tale of one region, one country or one political system. It is about a world, lost in post-truth and fake identities. It is about each and every one of us.","poster_path":"/egjOYURjYL1VzwOCgm9cUjWX6FF.jpg","popularity":3.259}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

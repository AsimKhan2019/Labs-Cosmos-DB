Unwilling to let the relief crew claims all the glory, he disobeys orders to pack up and goes out on an unauthorized expedition to collect further samples. But a routine excavation turns to disaster when the porous ground collapses and he falls into a deep crevice and near certain death. His devastated colleagues attempt to recover his body. However, when another vanishes, they start to suspect that the life-form they have discovered is not without danger.","poster_path":"/m0uxoxv6iJz6AdAFx5YOjPEKpTe.jpg","release_date":"2013-08-11","title":"The Last Days on Mars","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":422,"popularity":6.789}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

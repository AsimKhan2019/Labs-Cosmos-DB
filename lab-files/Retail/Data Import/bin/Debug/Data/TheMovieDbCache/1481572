Six New Yorkers juggle love, friendship, and the keenly challenging specter of adulthood. Sam Wexler is a struggling writer who's having a particularly bad day. When a young boy gets separated from his family on the subway, Sam makes the questionable decision to bring the child back to his apartment and thus begins a rewarding, yet complicated, friendship. Sam's life revolves around his friends â€” Annie, whose self-image keeps her from commitment; Charlie and Mary Catherine, a couple whose possible move to Los Angeles tests their relationship; and Mississippi, a cabaret singer who catches Sam's eye.","poster_path":"/w4omTuqEZO1GbuBuSgJIub3dCJe.jpg","popularity":5.864}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

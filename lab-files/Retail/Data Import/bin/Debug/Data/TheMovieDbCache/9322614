It's the greatest thing since the discovery of dinosaurs, but in order for it to succeed, he needs his right-hand, can-do problem solver, Claire Dearing, to get a trio of dinosaurs across the park to the new, super-secret exhibit. Reluctantly teaming up with newcomer Owen Grady, the animal behaviorist she hired sight unseen to deliver the dinosaurs, the duo sets out on a fun-filled adventure across the island. Unfortunately, delivering the dinosaurs to the new attraction is not as easy as they thought.","poster_path":"/v0hr8LOIpsobvVm7FogxaIg7gLx.jpg","release_date":"2018-11-29","title":"LEGO Jurassic World: The Secret Exhibit","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":4,"popularity":1.091}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

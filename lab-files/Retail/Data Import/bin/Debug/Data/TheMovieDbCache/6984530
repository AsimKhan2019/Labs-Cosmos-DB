He is an alcoholic, unemployed and terribly depressed, largely because of the death of his wife. However, Victor is still the best in one thing: telling fantastic stories to his nine-year-old son, Ingmar. These stories are each of the scripts he dreams of directing in the future, when he gathers all the necessary resources. Victor and Ingmar share a present full of sadness and precariousness, but also full of robots and locations of films they have seen together. Despite forming a great team, their problems will multiply when others begin to question their role as a father.","poster_path":"/xvdnPjkvOftz6drRiEeAK393hxL.jpg","release_date":"2018-08-31","title":"Up Among the Stars","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":10,"popularity":2.16}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

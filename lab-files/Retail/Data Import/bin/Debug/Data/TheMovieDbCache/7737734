The members of the Flock – all women and female children– live in a rural compound, and are led by one man, known only as Shepherd. Selah, a daughter who is on the cusp of teenage-hood, is given the great honor of participating in the sacred ritual of the birthing of the lambs – upon which they depend for survival – where she has a shocking and otherworldly experience. She begins to have strange visions that make her question her own reality, and everything the Shepherd has taught her and her sisters.","poster_path":"/tiqAuqj3mT0pFYXFbxGImDcvnvn.jpg","popularity":2.001}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

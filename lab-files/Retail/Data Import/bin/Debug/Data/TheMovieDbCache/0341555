Most students goof off: drinking, partying, and focusing on sex. Eun-shik, a law student who's been in the military, is older but socially inept. He likes Eun-hyo; even though his earnest and simple side appeals to her, his juvenile excesses make him irrelevant when Sung-ok, a good-looking rich kid, charms Eun-hyo. They begin an affair, leaving Eun-shik on the sidelines. The national competition approaches and complications arise.","poster_path":"/2OjlBy216BanqU9FEtkpvBVWk7t.jpg","release_date":"2002-12-12","title":"Sex Is Zero","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":40,"popularity":8.004}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

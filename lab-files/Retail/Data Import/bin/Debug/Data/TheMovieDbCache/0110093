He is her polar opposite: he chases women, smokes cigars, and has just published his first novel. During their pursuit of the story, Peter and Sabrina clash over virtually everything - he also subjects Sabrina to indecent exposure in front of a group of boy scouts after he catches her skinny dipping.","poster_path":"/2QoLPgwWphEO2eVDm6ehGxCWoXV.jpg","release_date":"1994-06-29","title":"I Love Trouble","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":93,"popularity":7.037}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

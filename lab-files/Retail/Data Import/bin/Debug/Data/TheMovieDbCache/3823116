But when the time comes to migrate to Africa, his stork family is forced to reveal his true identity and leave him behind in the forest, since he is not a migratory bird and would not survive the journey. Determined to prove he is a stork after all, Richard ventures south on his own. But only with the help of Olga, an eccentric owl with an imaginary friend and Kiki, a narcissistic, disco-singing parakeet, does he stand a chance to reach his goal and learn to accept who he really is.","poster_path":"/aKwgGlhdhdbx0duJhCRojkEZXgU.jpg","release_date":"2017-05-05","title":"A Stork's Journey","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":64,"popularity":6.338}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

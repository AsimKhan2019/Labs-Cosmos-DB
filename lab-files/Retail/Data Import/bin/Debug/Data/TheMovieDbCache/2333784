Stonebanks subsequently became a ruthless arms trader and someone who Barney was forced to kill… or so he thought. Stonebanks, who eluded death once before, now is making it his mission to end The Expendables -- but Barney has other plans. Barney decides that he has to fight old blood with new blood, and brings in a new era of Expendables team members, recruiting individuals who are younger, faster and more tech-savvy. The latest mission becomes a clash of classic old-school style versus high-tech expertise in the Expendables’ most personal battle yet.","poster_path":"/xczFwJhcCb2rUMylXam0Ni7Yn5o.jpg","popularity":15.746}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

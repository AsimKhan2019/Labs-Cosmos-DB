Wanting to prove he can be a good guy and not just a villain, Ralph escapes his game and lands in Hero's Duty, a first-person shooter where he helps the game's hero battle against alien invaders. He later enters Sugar Rush, a kart racing game set on tracks made of candies, cookies and other sweets. There, Ralph meets Vanellope von Schweetz who has learned that her game is faced with a dire threat that could affect the entire arcade, and one that Ralph may have inadvertently started.","poster_path":"/emJc3atQsh2vnTgogQiyDIHKKPB.jpg","popularity":21.497}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

After the rebellious Tano is arrested for his participation in a gas station robbery, he is sent from the city of Santiago to live with his estranged father in the remote mountain community of Wallmapu. There he meets Cheo, a shy Mapuche boy, who is being bullied at school. Though friendship between these two very different youths seems unlikely, the complications and violence of the world around them bonds them in unexpected and transformative ways.","poster_path":"/7bTRuWeENAMoNLKWd4WmZNiTt3S.jpg","release_date":"2018-03-14","title":"Bad Influence","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":3,"popularity":0.6}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

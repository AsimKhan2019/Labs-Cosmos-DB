The only hope is to get the forest preserved because it's the home of a protected bear, but there's a problem: the bear's the only bear in the forest, so she can't reproduce. Undaunted, Dolittle persuades a circus bear to help out, but he has to teach him not just the ways of the wild, but the wiles of lady bears too.","poster_path":"/aecUc1LobMV56Doj99ZvJR2dXgG.jpg","release_date":"2001-06-22","title":"Dr. Dolittle 2","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":923,"popularity":9.989}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

But when Jenko meets a kindred spirit on the football team, and Schmidt infiltrates the bohemian art major scene, they begin to question their partnership. Now they don't have to just crack the case - they have to figure out if they can have a mature relationship. If these two overgrown adolescents can grow from freshmen into real men, college might be the best thing that ever happened to them.","poster_path":"/gNlV5FhDZ1PjxSv2aqTPS30GEon.jpg","release_date":"2014-06-05","title":"22 Jump Street","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":5344,"popularity":14.364}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

They are helped economically by Pierpaolo, Luca’s seventeen-year-old son from a previous relationship. Pierpaolo lives in an Art Nouveau house with his mother and grandfather, an important trial lawyer of cases linked to politics who rakes in several million euros a year. In the setting of a magnificent and incomprehensible Rome, both a good mother and a bad one, Mary Ann, a deeply Catholic student of art history from Ireland, au pair for the little Lucilla, is caught in the middle.","poster_path":"/c596g57DNY8pBFFH7MQybEHJTPm.jpg","release_date":"2019-09-26","title":"To Live","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"popularity":2.717}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

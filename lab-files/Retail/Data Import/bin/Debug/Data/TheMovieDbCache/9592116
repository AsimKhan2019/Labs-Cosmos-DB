Here, they listen to spiders, discover black holes, and fight about what is going to steer a flying carpet. Together they search for the answers to life's big questions. But the brutality of the adult world makes itself known when terrorists detonate a bomb in the neighborhood. Aaatos envies Amine's Muslim faith and looks for his own gods, although his classmate Flo questions him; she is strongly convinced that anyone who believes in God is completely nuts. Gods of Molenbeek is a wonderful portrayal of childhood friendship, inquiry and the creation of meaning in a chaotic time.","poster_path":"/4QFwXz04kVeaQc3M8Z1E22vPmNu.jpg","release_date":"2019-08-09","title":"Gods of Molenbeek","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"popularity":1.053}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

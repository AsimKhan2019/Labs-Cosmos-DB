What brought such distant worlds together? Only Tony and Carlo, the two middle-aged heads of the families, know! The unexpected announcement of their engagement will disrupt an apparently ordinary summer and turn the lives of everyone around them upside down. With the wedding already set for three weeks, even more chaos will ensue.","poster_path":"/cZSKQEMf1707mtzWDUCYWgdFbm0.jpg","release_date":"2019-02-28","title":"An Almost Ordinary Summer","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":24,"popularity":4.945}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

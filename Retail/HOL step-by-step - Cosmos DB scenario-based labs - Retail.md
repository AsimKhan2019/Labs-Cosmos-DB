# Cosmos DB scenario-based labs - IoT hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on-lab, TODO

At the end of this lab you will TODO

## Overview

Contoso Movies, Ltd. has TODO

## Solution architecture (High-level)

![The proposed solution utilizing Azure Security Center for IoT and its agents to monitor and secure the IoT Devcies.  Log data is forwarded to Log Analytics where alerts and logic apps will execute to start investigation and remediation.](../Media/solution-diagram-1.png "Solution Architecture")

## Requirements

1. Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.

    - Trial subscriptions will not work.
    
## Before the hands-on lab

Refer to the Before the hands-on lab setup guide manual before continuing to the lab exercises.

## Exercise 1: Deployment and Setup

Duration: 30 minutes

Synopsis:  In this exercise you will TODO

### Task 1: Deploy the Azure Resources

1.  Run the Deploy.ps1 script to deploy the ARM template and do some time saving  setup and configuration.

## Exercise 2: Complete and deploy Web App and Function Apps

Duration: 30 minutes

Synopsis: We have pregenerated a set of events that include **buy** events.  Based on this information, a **Top Items** recommendation will be made to users that are new to the site.  You will implement this code in the web application and function applications, then deploy the applications to test the functionality.

### Task 1: Implement the Top Items recommendation

1.  In the **todo** project, open the **todod** file

1.  Find the todo task #1 and complete it with the following:

```csharp

```

1.  In the **todo** project, open the **todo** file

1.  Find the todo task #2 and complete it with the following:

```csharp

```

### Task 2: Deploy the applications

1.  Right-click the **todo** function app project, select **Publish**

1.  Select the Azure Subscription, Resource group and Function App to deploy too

1.  Right-click the **todo** web app project, select **Publish**

### Task 3: Test the applications

1.  In the browser window that opened from your web application deployment above, check to see that you received recommendations as a non-logged in user.  You should see the following:

**TODO**

>NOTE:  These are simply suggestions based on the top purchased items from the pre-generated events.

## Exercise 3: Perform and deploy association rules calculation for offline algorithms

Duration: 30 minutes

Synopsis: Based on the pre-calculated events in the Cosmos DB for our pre-defined personality types (Comedy fan, Drama fan, etc), you will implement and deploy an algorithm that will generate these associations and put them in Cosmos DB for offline processing by the web and function applications.

### Task 1: Implement the Association Rules

1.  Open your Azure DataBricks instance

1.  Run the following

1.  TODO

### Task 2: Review the data generated

1.  Open your Cosmos DB instance

>NOTE:  These items are created from the ...

## Exercise 4: Complete and deploy Web App and Function Apps (Association Rules)

Duration: 30 minutes

Synopsis: Now that we have data for our association calculations, we will add code to the web app and function app to support this new recommendation engine.

### Task 1: Implement the Associations recommendation

1.  In the **todo** project, open the **todod** file

1.  Find the todo task #3 and complete it with the following:

# Cosmos DB scenario-based labs - IoT hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on-lab, you will complete various tasks to implment a recommendation engine using several Microsoft Azure PaaS services.

At the end of this lab you will understand how to design offline recommendation systems that store data in Cosmos DB using Data Bricks.  You will also see how to implement a ecommerce store front utilizing Cosmos DB.  Additionally, you will see how to utilize the Cosmos DB change feed to execute functions for reporting and monitoring activities with Power BI and Logic Apps.

## Overview

Contoso Movies, Ltd. has express their desire to move to a more modern and cloud-based approach to their online ecommerce presence.  The have decided to utilize Cosmos DB and Azure Databricks to implement their next generate recommendation system.

## Solution architecture (High-level)

![The proposed solution utilizing Azure Security Center for IoT and its agents to monitor and secure the IoT Devcies.  Log data is forwarded to Log Analytics where alerts and logic apps will execute to start investigation and remediation.](../Media/solution-diagram-1.png "Solution Architecture")

## Requirements

1. Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.

    - Trial subscriptions will not work.
    
## Before the hands-on lab

Refer to the Before the hands-on lab setup guide manual before continuing to the lab exercises.

## Exercise 1: Configure Databricks and generate event data

Duration: 30 minutes

Synopsis: We have pre-generated a set of events that include **buy** and **details** events.  Based on this data, a **Top Items** recommendation will be made to users that are new to the site (aka a cold start recommendation).  You will implement this top items code in the web application and function applications, then deploy the applications to test the functionality.

### Task 1: Configure Azure Databricks

1.  Open the Azure Portal, navigate to your Azure DataBricks instance

1.  Click **Launch Workspace**, if prompted, login as the account you used to create your environment

1.  In the side navigation, click **Clusters**

![The cluster blade with all the settings filled in.](./media/xx_DataBricks_01.png "Databricks cluster configuration")

1.  Click **Create Cluster**

1.  On the create cluster form, provide the following:

   - **Cluster Name**: small

   - **Cluster Type**: Standard

   - **Databricks Runtime Version**: Runtime: 5.5 (Scala 2.11, Spark 2.4.3) (**Note**: the runtime version may have **LTS** after the version. This is also a valid selection.)

   - **Python Version**: 3

   - **Enable Autoscaling**: Uncheck this option.

   - **Auto Termination**: Check the box and enter 120

   - **Worker Type**: Standard_DS3_v2

   - **Driver Type**: Same as worker

   - **Workers**: 1

1.  Select **Create Cluster**.

![The cluster blade with all the settings filled in.](./media/xx_DataBricks_02.png "Databricks cluster configuration")

1.  Before continuing to the next step, verify that your new cluster is running.  Wait for the state to change from **Pending** to **Running**

1.  Click the **small** cluster, then click **Libraries**

1. Select **Install New**.

![Navigate to the libraries tab and click Install New.](./media/xx_DataBricks_03.png "Adding a new library")

1. In the Install Library dialog, select **Maven** for the Library Source

1.  In the Coordinates field type:

```text
com.microsoft.azure:azure-cosmosdb-spark_2.4.0_2.11:1.4.1
```

1. Select **Install**

![Populated library dialog for Maven.](./media/xx_DataBricks_04.png "Add the Maven library")

1. **Wait** until the library's status shows as **Installed** before continuing.

### Task 2: Populate event data

1. Within Azure Databricks, select **Workspace** on the menu, then **Users**, select your user, then select the down arrow on the top of your user workspace. Select **Import**.

1. Within the Import Notebooks dialog, select Import from: file, then drag-and-drop the file or browse to upload it ($githubdirectory/lab-files/Retail/Notebooks/02 Retail.dbc)

1.  Click **Import**

![Workspace is highlighted with the user expanded and the Import option highlighted.](./media/xx_DataBricks_07.png "Import the DataBricks notebook")

1. After importing, select the new **02 Retail** folder.

1.  Select **Event Generator**

1. Before you begin, make sure you attach your cluster to the notebooks using the dropdown. You will need to do this for each notebook you open. 

1.  Update the configuration settings for both the **readConfig** and the **writeConfig**, set the following using the values from your lab setup script:

- Endpoint = Cosmos DB endpoint
- Masterkey = Cosmos DB master key
- Database = Database id of the cosmos db ('movies')

![The configuration values in the notebook are highlighted.](./media/xx_DataBricks_06.png "Add the databrick notebook configuration settings")

1.  Click **Run All**

>NOTE:  This total process will take up to 30 minutes to generate the event data.

### Task 3: Review the data generated

1.  Open your Cosmos DB instance

1.  Open the **events** collection, review the items in the collection

![An example item from the events collection is displayed.](./media/xx_EventsColl.png "The events collection")

>NOTE:  These items are created from the data bricks solution and include a random set of generated events for each user personality type.  You should see events generated for 'details', 'buy' and 'addToCart' as well as the item associated (via the contentId field) with the event.

### Task 4: Review the aggregation and import utility

1.  Browse to the **$githubdirectory/lab-files/Retail/Starter/Contoso Movies** folder and open the **Contoso.Apps.Movies.sln** solution

1.  In the **/Utilities/MovieDataImport** project, open the **program.cs** file, browse code and various methods.  Notice that it:

- Aggregates all the event data generated from the Databricks notebook
- Creates the user personalities
- Creates the movie categories/genres
- Creates the movies

1.  Right-click the project, select **Set as startup project**

1.  Press **F5** to run the project

>NOTE:  You must have waited for the Event Generator DataBricks notebook to complete for this to run and have the late steps in the lab match.

## Exercise 2: Complete and deploy Web and Function Apps

Duration: 30 minutes

Synopsis: We have pre-generated a set of events that include **buy** events.  Based on this information, a **Top Items** recommendation will be made to users that are new to the site.  You will implement this code in the web application and function applications, then deploy the applications to test the functionality.

### Task 1: Implement the Top Items recommendation

1.  In the **Contoso.Apps.Movies.Web** project, open the **/Controllers/HomeController.cs** file

1.  Find the todo task #1 and complete it with the following:

```csharp
vm.RecommendProductsBought = RecommendationHelper.GetViaFunction("top", 0, 0);
```

1.  In the **Contoso.Apps.FunctionApp** project, open the **RecommendationHelper.cs** file

1.  In the **TopRecommendation** method, find the todo task #2 and complete it with the following:

```csharp
var container = client.GetContainer(databaseId, "object");

var query = container.GetItemLinqQueryable<Item>(true)
    .Where(c => c.EntityType == "ItemAggregation")
    .OrderByDescending(c => c.BuyCount)
    .Take(take);

items = query.ToList();

foreach(Item i in items)
{
    itemIds.Add(i.ItemId.ToString());
}

topItems = GetItemsByImdbIds(itemIds);
```

1.  Review the code, notice the following:

- We are querying an "object" collection for an entity type called 'ItemAggregation' and sorting it by the 'BuyCount'.  Essentially these are the top purchased items.
- We are then querying the object collection for all the top movie items to get their metadata for display on the web front end

1.  Compile the solution, fix any errors

### Task 2: Deploy the applications

1.  Right-click the **Consoto.Apps.FunctionApp** function app project, select **Publish**

1.  Click **New**, then ensure that **Azure Functions Premium Plan** is selected

![Select the Azure Functions Premium plan and then select 'select existing'](./media/xx_DeployFunction.png "Select a plan")

1.  Click **Select Existing**, then click **Publish**

1.  Select your Azure Subscription, resource group and Function App to deploy too, it should be something like **s2func...***

![Select the pre-created function app service that starts with s2func.](./media/xx_DeployFunction_02.png "Select the App Service")

1.  Click **OK**

1.  Right-click the **Contoso.Apps.Movies.Web** web app project, select **Publish**

1.  Click **New**, then ensure that **App Service** is selected

1.  Click **Select Existing**, then click **Publish**

1.  Select your Azure Subscription, resource group and Function App to deploy too, it should be something like **s2web...***

1.  Click **OK**, the application will publish and the site should be displayed:

### Task 3: Test the applications

1.  In the browser window that opened from your web application deployment above, check to see that you received recommendations as a non-logged in user.  You should see something similar to the following:

![The Contoso Movie website is displayed with the top purchased items as suggestions.](./media/xx_WebSite_01.png "Contoso Movies web site")

>NOTE:  These are simply suggestions based on the top purchased items from the pre-generated events.

## Exercise 3: Perform and deploy association rules calculation for offline algorithms

Duration: 30 minutes

Synopsis: Based on the pre-calculated events in the Cosmos DB for our pre-defined personality types (Comedy fan, Drama fan, etc), you will implement and deploy an algorithm that will generate these associations and put them in Cosmos DB for offline processing by the web and function applications.

### Task 1: Generate the Associations 

1.  Switch back to your Databricks workspace, select the **Association Rules** workbook

1.  Before you begin, make sure you attach your cluster to the notebooks, using the dropdown. You will need to do this for each notebook you open. 

1.  Update the configuration settings for both the **readEventsConfig** AND the **writeAssociationConfig**, set the following:

- Endpoint = Cosmos DB endpoint
- Masterkey = Cosmos DB master key
- Database = Database id of the cosmos db

1. Run each cell of the **Association Rules** notebook by selecting within the cell, then entering **Ctrl+Enter** on your keyboard. Pay close attention to the instructions within the notebook so you understand each step of the data preparation process.

### Task 2: Review the data generated

1.  Switch back to your Cosmos DB instance

1.  Open the **associations** collection, review the items in the collection

![An example item from the associations collection is displayed.](./media/xx_AssocColl.png "The associations collection")

>NOTE:  These items are created from the data bricks solution and include the association confidence level as compared from one movie to another movie.

## Exercise 4: Complete and deploy Web App and Function Apps (Association Rules)

Duration: 30 minutes

Synopsis: Now that we have data for our association calculations, we will add code to the web app and function app to support this new recommendation engine.

### Task 1: Implement the Associations recommendation rules

1.  In the **Contoso.Apps.FunctionApp** project, open the **RecommendationHelper.cs** file

1.  In the **AssociationRecommendationByUser** method, find the todo task #3 and complete it with the following:

```csharp
//get 20 log events for the user.
List<CollectorLog> logs = GetUserLogs(userId, 20);

if (logs.Count == 0)
    return items;

List<Rule> rules = GetSeededRules(logs);

//get the pre-seeded objects based on confidence
List<Recommendation> recs = new List<Recommendation>();

//for each rule returned, evaluate the confidence
foreach (Rule r in rules)
{
    Recommendation rec = new Recommendation();
    rec.id = int.Parse(r.target);
    rec.confidence = r.confidence;
    recs.Add(rec);

    itemIds.Add(rec.id.ToString());
}

items = GetItemsByImdbIds(itemIds);
```

1.  In the **Contoso.Apps.Movies.Web** project, open the **HomeController.cs** file

1.  Replace the **Index** method with the following:

```csharp
var vm = new HomeModel();

Contoso.Apps.Movies.Data.Models.User user = (Contoso.Apps.Movies.Data.Models.User)Session["User"];

if (user != null)
{
    vm.RecommendProductsBought = RecommendationHelper.GetViaFunction("assoc", user.UserId, 0);
    vm.RecommendProductsLiked = RecommendationHelper.GetViaFunction("collab", user.UserId, 0);
}
else
{
    vm.RecommendProductsBought = RecommendationHelper.GetViaFunction("top", 0, 0);
}

return View(vm);
```

### Task 2: Deploy the applications

1.  Right-click the **Consoto.Apps.FunctionApp** function app project, select **Publish**

1.  Click **Publish**

1.  Right-click the **Contoso.Apps.Movies.Web** web app project, select **Publish**

1.  Click **Publish**, the site should load.

### Task 3: Test the applications

1.  In the browser window that opened from your web application deployment above, check to see that you received recommendations as a non-logged in user.  You should see the same results as you received previously.

2.  Click **login**, select the **comedy@contosomovies.com** account

3.  Notice the main page now has different recommendations than what you received earlier, but we are still missing the similar 'liked' items:

## Exercise 5: Perform and deploy collaborative filtering rules calculation

Duration: 30 minutes

In this exercise you will defined

### Task 1: Compute the user implict ratings

1.  Switch back to your Databricks workspace, select **Ratings**

1.  Before you begin, make sure you attach your cluster to the notebooks, using the dropdown. You will need to do this for each notebook you open. 

1.  Update the configuration settings for both the **readEventsConfig** AND the **writeAssociationConfig**, set the following:

- Endpoint = Cosmos DB endpoint
- Masterkey = Cosmos DB master key
- Database = Database id of the cosmos db

1. Run each cell of the **Ratings** notebook by selecting within the cell, then entering **Ctrl+Enter** on your keyboard. Pay close attention to the instructions within the notebook so you understand each step of the data preparation process.

![An example item from the ratings collection is displayed.](./media/xx_RatingsColl.png "The ratings collection")

>NOTE:  These ratings are generated as part of this notebook as an 'offline' operation.  If you collect a significant amount of user data, you would need to reevaluate the events using this notebook and populate the ratings collection again for the online calculations to utilize.

### Task 2: Generate the Collaborative Rules

1.  Open the **Similarity** notebook

1.  Set the cluster

1. Run each cell of the **Similarity** notebook by selecting within the cell, then entering **Ctrl+Enter** on your keyboard. Pay close attention to the instructions within the notebook so you understand each step of the data preparation process.

### Task 3: Review the data generated

1.  Open your Cosmos DB instance

1.  Open the **similarity** collection, review the items in the collection

>NOTE:  These items are created from the data bricks solution and include the similarity of one movie, the source, to another, the target.

![An example item from the similarity collection is displayed.](./media/xx_SimilarityColl.png "The similarity collection")

### Task 4: Implement the Collaborative recommendation rules

if (userRatedItems.Count == 0)
    return new List<string>();

//this is the mean rating a user gave
double ratingSum = 0;

foreach(double r in userRatedItems.Values)
{
    ratingSum += r;
}

double userMean = ratingSum / userRatedItems.Count;

//get similar items
List<SimilarItem> candidateItems = GetCandidateItems(userRatedItems.Keys, minSim);

//sort by similarity desc, take only max candidates
candidateItems = candidateItems.OrderByDescending(c=>c.similarity).Take(maxCandidates).ToList();

Hashtable recs = new Hashtable();

List<PredictionModel> precRecs = new List<PredictionModel>();

foreach(SimilarItem candidate in candidateItems)
{
    int target = candidate.Target;
    double pre = 0;
    double simSum = 0;

    List<SimilarItem> ratedItems = candidateItems.Where(c=>c.Target == target).Take(neighborhoodSize).ToList();

    if (ratedItems.Count > 1)
    {
        foreach (SimilarItem simItem in ratedItems)
        {
            try
            {
                string source = userRatedItems[simItem.sourceItemId].ToString();

                //rating of the movie - userMean;

>NOTE:  If your job fails for any reason, you can use the **Activity Log** to see what the error(s) were.

### Task 2: Configure the ChangeFeed Function

1.  In the **Contoso.Apps.FunctionApp** project, open the **FuncChangeFeed.cs** file

1.  Take a moment to review the function signature.  Notice how it is trigger based on a Cosmos DB collection

1.  Find the todo task #5 and complete it with the following:

```csharp
AddEventToEventHub(events);
```

1.  Add the following method to the function class:

```csharp
public void AddEventToEventHub(IReadOnlyList<Document> events)
{
    try
    {
        //event hub connection
        EventHubClient eventHubClient;
        string EventHubConnectionString = config["eventHubConnection"];
        string EventHubName = "store";

        var connectionStringBuilder = new EventHubsConnectionStringBuilder(EventHubConnectionString)
        {
            EntityPath = EventHubName
        };

        eventHubClient = EventHubClient.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionStringBuilder.ToString());

        foreach (var e in events)
        {
            string data = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(e);
            var result = eventHubClient.SendAsync(new EventData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(data)));
        }
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        log.LogError(ex.Message);
    }
}

# Cosmos DB scenario-based labs - Retail hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this demo you will show your audience how to uiltize Azure services to host a movie retail store with custom AI models and CosmosDb.  Several other PaaS based technologies will be used to show how Azure can be used to migrate legacy applications to the cloud.

## Overview

Contoso Movies, Ltd. has redesigned its website to utilize Azure PaaS services including CosmosDb, Functions, EventHubs, Stream Analytics, Power BI and Logic Apps.  As part of this redesign they have also implemented a new recommendation system based on custom AI models.  These AI models are done **offline** and stored in CosmosDb for reference when users are browing a site.  User events will immplicitly rank the items they are clicking on and then modify their recommendations based on these events.

## Solution architecture (High-level)

![TODO.](../Media/solution-diagram-1.png "Solution Architecture")

## Requirements

1. Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.

    - Trial subscriptions will not work.
    
## Before the demo

Refer to the Before the hands-on lab setup guide manual before continuing to the lab exercises.

## Exercise 1: Deployment and Setup

Duration: 60 minutes

Synopsis:  In this exercise you will TODO

### Task 1: Configure Stream Analytics

1.  Set all the Azure resource configurations

### Task 2: Setup Power BI

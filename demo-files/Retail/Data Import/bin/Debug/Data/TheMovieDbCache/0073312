Allen's cowardice serves him well when he hides in a cannon and is shot into a tent of French soldiers, making him a national hero. A hilarious parody of Russian literature, Love and Death is a must-see for fans of Allen's films.","poster_path":"/qRNisGLmcHoEvMjzcvVlcdCnOhO.jpg","release_date":"1975-06-10","title":"Love and Death","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":374,"popularity":9.253}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

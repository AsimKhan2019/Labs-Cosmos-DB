Jaeger Lieutenant Nyborg, an admirer of Parikka, suspects a definite miscarriage of justice. He wants to save the actors. The forthcoming visit of the German General von der Goltz to the prison island provides him with a suitable opportunity. Nyborg suggests that the actors prepare a comical performance for the visitor and not be shot. Instead, they will be given a new trial. Preparing a comedy in the horrible circumstances, in the midst of hunger and death, seems quite an overwhelming task. Only a handful of real actors are still alive, the rest of the troupe consists of stagehands. Parikka has to use all his inventive skills to be able to produce something funny.","poster_path":"/7L0QhTjs5dmOxbPUt5GCsrn0OF1.jpg","release_date":"2018-03-16","title":"Laugh or Die","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":4,"popularity":2.971}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

This is the challenge Guillaume took up. The film recounts Guillaume's tragicomic battle from the young age of eight, as he adopts the role of a girl then of a homosexual... until, aged 30, he meets the woman who, after his mother, will become the other woman in his life. Beyond this story of a heterosexual coming-out, the film tells the tale of an actor who never stopped loving women, maybe even a little too much.","poster_path":"/j4CUnYba347STXbW4PsrMfUPB3y.jpg","release_date":"2013-11-20","title":"Me, Myself and Mum","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":436,"popularity":8.157}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

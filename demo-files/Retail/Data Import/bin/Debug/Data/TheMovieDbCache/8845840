Surrounded by foxes, deer, badgers, and dogs, he lives in a small building next to the house of the facility's master. He treats the dogs, cleans the kennels, oversees the workers, and meets with clients and their dogs. It's easier for him to get along with dogs than with people. Egor is willing to take on any job to get closer to the facility's master and his near and dear. He wants the impossible - to become a member of that family.","poster_path":"/eYl883iqYF3mn7kRebq72PhPFzb.jpg","release_date":"2018-09-27","title":"Core of the World","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":5,"popularity":1.239}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

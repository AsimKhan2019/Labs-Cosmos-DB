Actually, he took the job after his father and never went into the savanna by himself. As he owes big money to some mobster, he is compelled to convey a fake tourist, with a suspicious suitcase, toward Mozambic. To avoid suspicion from the authorities, he is supposed to tour a group of tourists as usual. The only problem - he is completely unexperienced as a guide!","poster_path":"/turLzrgAULmR3oENbOcOIKaKEbo.jpg","release_date":"2009-04-01","title":"Safari","video":false,"vote_average":4.6,"vote_count":208,"popularity":7.108}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}

### Task 1: Open and refresh the report in Power BI Desktop

1. Open **Power BI Desktop**, then re-open the report.

2. Select the tab at the bottom of the report to view the Maintenance page. This page shows results from the batch scoring notebook you executed in Databricks. If you do not see records here, then you need to run the entire batch scoring notebook after some trips have completed.

3. Update the report with new data by clicking the **Refresh** button. This will show the results of the batch scoring notebook if you had one or more completed trips prior to running the notebook.

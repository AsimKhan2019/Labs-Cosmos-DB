## After the hands-on lab

Duration: 10 mins

In this exercise, you will delete any Azure resources that were created in support of the lab. You should follow all steps provided after attending the Hands-on lab to ensure your account does not continue to be charged for lab resources.

### Task 1: Delete the resource group

1. Using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to the Resource group you used throughout this hands-on lab by selecting Resource groups in the left menu.

2. Search for the name of your resource group, and select it from the list.

3. Select Delete in the command bar, and confirm the deletion by re-typing the Resource group name, and selecting Delete.

You should follow all steps provided _after_ attending the Hands-on lab.

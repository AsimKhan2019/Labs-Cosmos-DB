## Task 1: Authenticate the Office 365 API Connection for sending email alerts

In this task, you will open the deployed Logic App workflow and configure it to send email alerts through its HTTP trigger. This trigger will be called by one of your Azure functions that gets triggered by the Cosmos DB change feed, any time a notification event occurs, such as completing a trip. You will need to have an Office 365 or Outlook.com account to send the emails.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your resource group for this demo and open the **Logic App**.

2. Select **API connections** in the left-hand menu, then select the **office365** API connection.

    ![API connections lists the office365 connection in its blade.](../media/logic-app-connections.png "API connections")

3. In the API connection window, select **Edit API connection** in the left-hand menu, then select **Authorize**.

    ![Authorize the API connection.](../media/logic-app-authorize-office-365-api-connection.png 'Authorize Logic App Office 365 API Connection')

4. Authenticate using the account you used to deploy the demo in Setup task 3, "Run deployment scripts".

    ![Authenticate to continue API connection authorization](../media/azure-authenticate.png 'Authenticate to continue API connection authorization')

5. When a message is displayed that Authorization was successful, select **Save**. After a few seconds, a notification will confirm API connection save.

    ![API connection save result notification](../media/logic-app-api-connection-save-result-notification.png 'API connection save result notification')

Return to your demo resource group to continue with the next steps.

## Task 2: Authenticate Stream Analytics Power BI output and start job

1. **If you have never signed in to Power BI with this account**, open a new browser tab and navigate to <https://powerbi.com> and sign in. Confirm any messages that appear and continue to the next step after the home page appears. This will help the connection authorization step from Stream Analytics succeed and find the group workspace.

2. In your demo resource group, open your **Stream Analytics job**.

   ![The Stream Analytics job is highlighted in the resource group.](../media/resource-group-stream-analytics.png 'The Stream Analytics job is highlighted in the resource group.')

3. In the left-hand menu, select **Outputs**, then select **powerbi**.

   ![Selecting the Power BI output.](../media/stream-analytics-outputs-demo.png 'Selecting the Power BI output.')

4. On **Output details**, select **Renew authorization**.

   ![Authorizing the Power BI output.](../media/stream-analytics-outputs-authorize-power-bi.png 'Authorizing the Power BI output.')

5. Authenticate using the account you used to deploy the demo in Setup task 3, "Run deployment scripts".

    ![Authenticate to continue Power BI output authorization](../media/azure-authenticate.png 'Authenticate to continue Power BI output authorization')

6. When a message is displayed that the output is **Currently authorized as (your account)**, select **Save**. After a few seconds, notifications will confirm that the output was edited, and that a connection test succeeded.

    ![Save Power BI output after authorizing.](../media/stream-analytics-outputs-save-power-bi.png 'Save Power BI output after authorizing.')

    ![Azure portal notifications that Power BI output was edited and connection test was successful.](../media/stream-analytics-outputs-authorize-power-bi-notifications.png 'Azure portal notifications that Power BI output was edited and connection test was successful.')

7. In the left-hand menu, select **Overview**, then select **Start**. On the right **Start job** blade, select **Now** for the **Job output start time**, then select **Start**. After a few seconds, a notification will show that the job is starting.

   ![The steps to start the job are displayed.](../media/stream-analytics-start-job.png 'The steps to start the job are displayed.')

   ![A notification shows that the job is starting.](../media/stream-analytics-start-job-notification1.png 'A notification shows that the job is starting.')

   ![A notification shows that the job has started successfully.](../media/stream-analytics-start-job-notification2.png 'A notification shows that the job has started successfully.')

Return to your demo resource group to continue with the next steps.

## Task 3: Add your user account to Key Vault access policy

Perform these steps to create an access policy for your user account so you can manage secrets. Since we created Key Vault with a template, your account was not automatically added to the access policies.

1. Within Key Vault, select **Access policies** in the left-hand menu.

2. Select **+ Add Access Policy**.

   ![The Add Access Policy link is highlighted.](../media/key-vault-add-access-policy.png "The Add Access Policy link is highlighted.")

3. Select the **Select principal** section on the Add access policy form.

   ![Select principal is highlighted.](../media/key-vault-add-access-policy-select-principal.png 'Add access policy')

4. In the Principal blade, search for the Azure account you are using for this lab, select it, then select the **Select** button.

   ![The user principal is selected.](../media/key-vault-principal-user.png "The user principal is selected.")

5. Expand the **Secret permissions** and check **Select all** under Secret Management Operations. All 8 should be selected.

   ![The Select all checkbox is checked under the Secret permissions dropdown.](../media/key-vault-all-secret-policy.png "The Select all checkbox is checked under the Secret permissions dropdown.")

6. Select **Add** to add the new access policy.. When you are done, you should have an access policy for your user account. Select **Save** to save your new access policy.

    ![Key Vault access policies.](../media/key-vault-access-policies-user.png "Key Vault access policies.")

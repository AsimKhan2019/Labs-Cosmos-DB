## Requirements

1. Microsoft Azure subscription
   - Must be Enterprise, Pay-as-you-go, or MSDN
   - Trial or free subscriptions will not work for this lab
   - **IMPORTANT**: To complete identity provisioning steps, you must have authorization to create App Registrations and Service Principals in your Azure Active Directory.
2. Power BI Desktop. Install with [standard installer](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/) or [Microsoft store](https://www.microsoft.com/p/power-bi-desktop/9ntxr16hnw1t)
3. Visual Studio 2019, any edition. Install [Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
4. [.NET Core SDK 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)
   - **IMPORTANT**: If you are using Visual Studio, install the latest SDK that supports Visual Studio 2019. If you are not using Visual Studio, install the latest SDK.

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 10 minutes

In this exercise, you will set up your environment for use in the rest of the hands-on lab. You should follow all steps before starting the Hands-on lab.

> **IMPORTANT**: Many Azure resources require unique names. Throughout these steps you will see the word "SUFFIX" as part of resource names. You should replace this with your Microsoft alias, initials, or another value to ensure resources are uniquely named.

### Task 1: Install .NET Core SDK 3.1

The starter solution requires .NET Core SDK 3.1 to be installed on your machine.

1. Navigate to the [.NET Core 3.1 download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1), then download and install the correct SDK for your environment.

   ![The webpage is displayed with the SDK download section highlighted.](../media/dotnet-sdk-3-1.png 'Download .NET Core 3.1')

### Task 2: Download the lab files

Download files used in the lab, including a Visual Studio solution with vehicle simulator, Azure Function App, and Web App projects; Jupyter notebooks; a Power BI report; and associated data files.

#### Method 1: Download a ZIP file (better if you need the simplest path and don't plan to contribute changes)

1. From your lab computer, download a .zip file of the Cosmos DB scenario-based labs GitHub repo.

2. In a web browser, navigate to the [Cosmos DB scenario-based labs repo](https://github.com/AzureCosmosDB/scenario-based-labs).

3. On the repo page, select **Clone or download**, then select **Download ZIP**.

   ![Download .zip containing the repository](../media/github-download-repo.png 'Download ZIP')

4. Unzip the downloaded file on your computer. This will create a folder named `scenario-based-labs-master` which contains all lab files.

#### Method 2: Clone the github repository (better if you plan to contribute changes)

If you are familiar with git source control tools, you can clone the repository to your computer instead of downloading the ZIP file. You can also fork the repository to your github account and clone it to your computer from there.

This will enable you to push your changes to your own github account and repository, and to work with this lab independently and perhaps even submit Pull Requests (PRs) back to the source repository if you make changes to the lab that could benefit others.

If you are not familiar with git and typical git operation flow (fork, clone, push, PR, etc.), please use Method 1 (ZIP file download) instead. Git usage details will not be further documented here.

### Task 3: Run deployment scripts

In this task, you will deploy the infrastructure for this demo using an ARM Template deployment.

1. Select the **Deploy to Azure** button below to get started. When prompted, sign in to the Azure portal with your account.

   <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzureCosmosDB%2Fscenario-based-labs%2Fmaster%2FIoT%2Fdeploy%2Fdemo.deploy.json" target="_blank">
   <img src="http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png"/>
   </a>

2. Enter the following values:

   - BASICS section:
     - **Subscription**: select the Azure subscription you are using for this lab.
     - **Resource group**: _if you are using a hosted environment, select the existing `iot` resource group provided for you_; Otherwise, create a new resource group. Provide a meaningful name like `cosmos-db-iot` and note it, as you will need to navigate to this Resource Group in the Azure portal for later tasks.
     - **Location**: select an Azure region for the Resource Group that will hold all deployed resources.
   - SETTINGS section:
     - **Location**: select an Azure region for all deployed resources. _The options in this list are limited to those Azure regions in which all the services deployed in this lab are available_.

3. Check the **I agree to the terms and conditions stated above** box.

   ![The fields are completed as shown.](../media/portal-template-deploy-demo.png 'Custom template form')

4. Select **Purchase**.

5. After the deployment completes, you can select **Outputs** from the left-hand menu to find the names of your new Azure resources, as well as useful information like connection strings and endpoints. **Copy these values** to a preferred text editor. These outputs can also be referenced later as needed.

   ![The outputs are displayed after the template deployment is completed.](../media/portal-deployment-outputs.png 'Microsoft Template - Outputs')

The template deployment will take several minutes to complete. Continue with the demo guide once it completes.

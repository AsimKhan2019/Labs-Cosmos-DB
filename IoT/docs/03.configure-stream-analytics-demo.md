## Task 1: Authenticate Stream Analytics Power BI output

1. **If you have never signed in to Power BI with this account**, open a new browser tab and navigate to <https://powerbi.com> and sign in. Confirm any messages that appear and continue to the next step after the home page appears. This will help the connection authorization step from Stream Analytics succeed and find the group workspace.

2. In your demo resource group, open your **Stream Analytics job**.

## Task 2: Start Stream Analytics job

1. In the left-hand menu, select **Overview**, then select **Start**. On the right **Start job** blade, select **Now** for the **Job output start time**, then select **Start**. After a few seconds, a notification will show that the job is starting.

<!-- /TOC -->

In this exercise, we use the Live Metrics Stream feature of Application Insights to view the incoming requests, outgoing requests, overall health, allocated server information, and sample telemetry in near-real time. This will help you observe how your functions scale under load and allow you to spot any potential bottlenecks or problematic components, through a single interactive interface.

### Task 1: Open App Insights Live Metrics Stream

1. In the Azure portal (<https://portal.azure.com>), open the Application Insights instance within your **cosmos-db-iot** resource group.

    ![The App Insights resource is displayed in the resource group.](../media/portal-resource-group-app-insights.png "Application Insights")

2. Select **Live Metrics Stream** in the left-hand menu.

    ![The Live Metrics Stream link is displayed in the left-hand menu.](../media/app-insights-live-metrics-stream-link.png "Application Insights")

3. Observe the metrics within the Live Metrics Stream as data flows through the system.

    ![The Live Metrics Stream page is displayed.](../media/app-insights-live-metrics-stream.png "Live Metrics Stream")

    At the top of the page, you will see a server count. This shows how many instances of the Function Apps there are, and one server is allocated to the Web App. As the Function App server instances exceed computational, memory, or request duration thresholds, and as the IoT Hub and Change Feed queues grow and age, new instances are automatically allocated to scale out the Function Apps. You can view the server list at the bottom of the page. On the right-hand side you will see sample telemetry, including messages sent to the logger within the functions. Here we highlighted a message stating that the Cosmos DB Processing function is sending 100 Cosmos DB records to Event Hubs.

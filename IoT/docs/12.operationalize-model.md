## Exercise 11: Deploy the predictive maintenance web service

**Duration**: 20 minutes

In addition to batch scoring, Contoso Auto would like to predict battery failures on-demand in real time for any given vehicle. They want to be able to call the model from their Fleet Management website when looking at a vehicle to predict whether that vehicle's battery may fail in the next 30 days.

In the previous task, you executed a notebook that used a pre-trained ML model to predict battery failures for all vehicles with trip data in a batch process. But how do you take that same model and deploy it (in data science terms, this is called "operationalization") to a web service for this purpose?

In this task, you will run the `Model_Deployment` notebook to deploy the pre-trained model to a web service hosted by Azure Container Instances (ACI), using your Azure ML workspace. While it is possible to deploy the model to a web service running in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), we are deploying to ACI instead since doing so saves 10-20 minutes. However, once deployed, the process used to call the web service is the same, as are most of the steps to do the deployment.

### Task 1: Run deployment notebook

To run this notebook, perform the following steps:

1. In Azure Synapse, select **Develop**, select **Notebooks**

1. Select the **Model Deployment** notebook to open it.

1. As with the Batch_Scoring notebook, be sure to attach your lab cluster before executing cells.

1. **After you are finished running the notebook**, open the Azure Machine Learning service workspace in the portal, then select **Models** in the left-hand menu to view the pre-trained model.

1. Select **Deployments** in the left-hand menu, then select the Azure Container Instances deployment that was created when you ran the notebook.

1. Copy the **Scoring URI** value. This will be used by the deployed web app to request predictions in real time.

### Task 2: Call the deployed scoring web service from the Web App

Now that the web service is deployed to ACI, we can call it to make predictions from the Fleet Management Web App. To enable this capability, we first need to update the Web App's application configuration settings with the scoring URI.

1. Make sure you have copied the Scoring URI of your deployed service, as instructed in the previous task.

1. Open the Web App (App Service) whose name begins with **IoTWebApp**.

1. Select **Configuration** in the left-hand menu.

1. Scroll to the **Application settings** section then select **+ New application setting**.

1. In the Add/Edit application setting form, enter `ScoringUrl` for the **Name**, and paste the web service URI you copied and paste it in the **Value** field. Select **OK** to add the setting.

    ![The form is filled in with the previously described values.](./../media/app-setting-scoringurl.png "Add/Edit application setting")

1. Select **Save** to save your new application setting.

1. Go back to the **Overview** blade for the Web App, then select **Restart**.

1. Navigate to the deployed Fleet Management web app and open a random Vehicle record. Select **Predict battery failure**, which calls your deployed scoring web service and makes a prediction for the vehicle.

    ![The prediction results show that the battery is not predicted to fail in the next 30 days.](./../media/web-prediction-no.png "Vehicle details with prediction")

    This vehicle has a low number of **Lifetime cycles used**, compared to the battery's rated 200 cycle lifespan. The model predicted that the battery will not fail within the next 30 days.

1. Look through the list of vehicles to find one whose **Lifetime cycles used** value is closer to 200, then make the prediction for the vehicle.

    ![The prediction results show that the battery is is predicted to fail in the next 30 days.](./../media/web-prediction-yes.png "Vehicle details with prediction")

    This vehicle has a high number of **Lifetime cycles used**, which is closer to the battery's rated 200 cycle lifespan. The model predicted that the battery will fail within the next 30 days.

In this exercise, you will configure the web app to call the real-time predictive model you deployed in the previous exercise via a REST API call, enabling the real-time predictive capability on the vehicle details view.

Then you will perform a batch prediction on the vehicles dataset and write the predictions back to Cosmos DB.
